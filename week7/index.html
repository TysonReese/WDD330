    Week 7 Notes
</h1>

    Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.<br>
    The use of Ajax revolutionized how websites worked, and ushered in a new age of web applications. Web pages were no longer static, but dynamic applications.<br>
    The web of computers known as the internet can be separated into two parts: clients and servers. A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the request and sends back a response to the client.<br>
    JavaScript was originally designed as a client-side scripting language, meaning that it ran locally in the browser, adding dynamic features to the web page that was returned from the server. Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. The resources requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole web page.<br>
    The XMLHttpRequest object was finally standardized by the WHATWG and W3C as part of the HTML5 specification, despite it originally being implemented by Microsoft many years earlier, and already available in most browsers.<br>
    The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch. A very basic example would look something like the following piece of code:<br>

    Fetch Example:<br>
    <img src="fetch.png"><br>

    JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. The json() method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.<br>
    JSON Example:<br>
    <img src="JSON.png"><br>
    HTTP headers are used to pass on any additional information about a request or response. Typical information contained in headers includes the file-type of the resource, cookie information, authentication information and when the resource was last modified.<br>

<h2>Questions:</h2>
<p>
  Why is it that sometimes when I load into a page it gives me an HTTP code like 400 or 404 but if I refesh it, it connects? Does it just have a hard time finding all the data at first? Or if a page is slow, refreshing fixes it, most of the time.
