    Week 3 Notes

    An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions. They act as a collection of named properties that map to any JavaScript value such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and functions.<br>
    To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces. const spiderman = {};  <br>
    You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation that weve already seen in previous chapters.<br>
    If you try to access a property that doesnâ€™t exist, undefined will be returned<br>
    New properties and methods can be added to objects at any time in a program. This is done by simply assigning a value to the new property. For example, if we wanted to add a new city property to our superman object, we would do it like so: superman.city = 'Metropolis'; << 'Metropolis'<br>
    Any property can be removed from an object using the delete operator. For example, if we wanted to remove the fly method from the superman object, we would enter the following: delete superman.fly << true

    The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.<br>
    The DOM treats everything on a web page as a node. HTML tags, the text inside these tags, even the attributes of a tag are all nodes. The HTML tag is the root node, and every other part of the document is a child node of this. Take the following piece of HTML as an example: <br>
    "p class='warning'>Something has gone em very/em wrong!/p<br>
   <img src="dom.png"><br>
   Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions. Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to.

<h2>Questions:</h2>
