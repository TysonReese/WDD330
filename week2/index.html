    “If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps.” – Joel Marsh – The Hipper Element

    JavaScript, often referred to as the language of the web.<br>
    An array is an ordered list of values. To create an array literal, simply write a pair of square brackets <br>
    Each item in an array can be treated like a variable<br>
    A function is a chunk of code that can be referenced by a name, and is almost like a small, self-contained mini program. Functions can help reduce repetition and make code easier to follow.<br>
    To define a function literal we can use a function declaration <br>
    Another way of defining a function literal is to create a function expression. This assigns an anonymous function to a variable
</p>

<p>
    A function can also be declared using the constructor Function(). The body of the function is entered as a string<br>
    It's not recommended to declare functions in this way as there are numerous problems associated with placing the function body inside a string. <br>
    Invoking a function is to run the code inside the function’s body. To invoke a function, simply enter its name, followed by parentheses<br>
    All functions return a value, which can be specified using the return statement, which comes after the return keyword<br>
    Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably to represent values provided for the function as an input.
</p>

<h2>Questions:</h2>
<p>
    I'm still not sure when its better to use var, let, or const when making a variable. I see some people use different ones when its not needed. Is it okay to just use let or const instead of var? Why have var is let and const have more functions?
