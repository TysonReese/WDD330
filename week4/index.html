    Week 4 Notes

    Forms are a very common method of interacting with a web page. A form is the main component of Google’s home page, and most of us use forms every day to log in to our favorite sites. <br>
    Forms are made up of a <form> element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons. These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once the form has been submitted. <br>
    The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup.<br>
    Form objects have a number of useful properties and methods that can be used to interact with the form.<br>

    The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.

    The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server:<br>
    Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. This approach has the benefit of keeping related pieces of code encapsulated in objects that maintain state throughout the life of the program <br>
    Many object-oriented languages, such as Java and Ruby, are known as class-based languages. This is because they use a class to define a blueprint for an object.<br>

    In the team activity solution code, I found that on this line it uses 3 equal signs. I looked up what the difference is and understand the difference but I don't know why theres 3 signs when 2 would work just fine. My roommate and I discussed it for a while and are stumped on it.
