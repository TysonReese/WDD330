    Week 1 Notes
</h1>
<h2>
    “If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps.” – Joel Marsh – The Hipper Element
</h2>
<p>
    Develop for mobile first and desktop last <br>
    Mobile and Tablets passed the Personal Computer in 2011<br>
    Desktops replace every 4-5 years while mobile devices replace every ~2 years<br>
    2 to 3 devices per person, per household<br>
    “The simple guideline is whatever you are doing, do mobile first” – Eric Schmidt<br>
    A responsive website doesn’t mean its mobile first
</p>
<ul>Mobile First:
<li>Time consuming and costly for a full rebuild</li>
<li>Provides best experiences across many devices</li>
<li>Address constraints for mobile size/bandwidth</li>
<li>Future friendly and ready for growth</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Desktop computer sales have been declining since 2011<br>
    You don’t see people with their heads in laptops<br>
    Start small and scale up<br>
    Mobile is not a fad<br>
